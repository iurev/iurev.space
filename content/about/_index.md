# About me

## My technologies

- ReactJS with optional redux, jest, postcss, etc...
- Ruby on Rails as one of the best backend frameworks and it's infrastructure

I really appreciate what authors have done to these frameworks.
They made stable API which is easy to learn and apply in many different tasks.
